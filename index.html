          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Health Risks and Age, Income</h2>
          <p>When surrounded by a transparent emission region, black holes are expected to reveal a dark shadow caused by gravitational light 
            bending and photon capture at the event horizon. To image and study this phenomenon, we have assembled the Event Horizon Telescope, 
            a global very long baseline interferometry array observing at a wavelength of 1.3 mm. This allows us to reconstruct event-horizon-scale 
            images of the supermassive black hole candidate in the center of the giant elliptical galaxy M87. We have resolved the central compact 
            radio source as an asymmetric bright emission ring with a diameter of 42 ± 3 μas, which is circular and encompasses a central depression 
            in brightness with a flux ratio gsim10:1. The emission ring is recovered using different calibration and imaging schemes, with its 
            diameter and width remaining stable over four different observations carried out in different days. Overall, the observed image is 
            consistent with 
            expectations for the shadow of a Kerr black hole as predicted by general relativity. The asymmetry in brightness in the ring can be 
            explained in terms of relativistic beaming of the emission from a plasma rotating close to the speed of light around a black hole. We 
            compare our images to an extensive library of ray-traced general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of black holes and derive 
            a central mass of M = (6.5 ± 0.7) × 109 M⊙. Our radio-wave observations thus provide powerful evidence for the presence of supermassive 
            black holes in centers of galaxies and as the central engines of active galactic nuclei. They also present a new tool to explore gravity 
            in its most extreme limit and on a mass scale that was so far not accessible.</p>
